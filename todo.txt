TO DO:
- Add additional inputs that allow the user to specify the minimum/maximum range. <----- return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
- Upon successful win, user’s range is updated:
- Every time the user wins a round increase the maximum number by 10.
- Every time the user wins a round decrease the minimum number by 10.
- Appropriate UI is incorporated such that user understands what is happening.

(Pro-tip: You’ll need to adjust the input fields to accept the new minimum and maximum numbers.)


ISSUES:
- How to create an error message? Is there a better way to do it than this:
    alert("ERROR: You must choose a number between 1-100");
    userGuess.value = "";
